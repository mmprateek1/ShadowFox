# Boston House Price Prediction Model

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting house prices using the classic Boston Housing dataset. It covers data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and comparison of two different regression models.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`) in Boston based on 13 different features.

The notebook explores two models:
1.  A baseline **Linear Regression** model.
2.  A more advanced **Random Forest Regressor** to improve upon the baseline.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset**, which contains 506 instances and 14 columns (13 features and 1 target variable).

**Features include:**
- `CRIM`: Per capita crime rate by town
- `RM`: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- `AGE`: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- `LSTAT`: Percentage of lower status of the population

**Target Variable:**
- `MEDV`: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The project follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading**: The `HousingData.csv` file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values (`NaN`) in the dataset are identified and filled with the mean of their respective columns to ensure the data is clean for modeling.
3.  **Feature and Target Separation**: The dataset is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`, which is `MEDV`).
4.  **Train-Test Split**: The data is divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
5.  **Model Training**:
    * A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the training data as a baseline.
    * A **Random Forest Regressor** model is also trained to see if a more complex model can achieve better results.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: The models' performances are evaluated on the test set using two key metrics:
    * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
    * **R-squared ($R^2$) Score**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.

The performance of the two models was compared, showing a significant improvement with the Random Forest Regressor.

-   **Linear Regression (Baseline)**:
    -   Mean Squared Error (MSE): 25.02
    -   R-squared ($R^2$) Score: **0.66**
-   **Random Forest Regressor**:
    -   R-squared ($R^2$) Score: **0.89**

The Random Forest model was able to explain **89%** of the variance in house prices, compared to **66%** by the Linear Regression model.

### Visualization

The scatter plot below shows the relationship between the actual prices and the prices predicted by the baseline Linear Regression model. The red line represents a perfect prediction.
